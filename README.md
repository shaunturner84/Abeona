# Abeona
Abeona was the goddess of outward journeys and protector of children when they leave home. The Abeona project is a home education project to help us teach our kids about computers, data and travel.

The project is intended to start off as a place to provide reviews of various attractions, playgrounds, etc. The idea is to collect information and use this information to demonstrate how you can analyse and represent data in a variety of ways.
