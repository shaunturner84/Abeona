# Abeona
Abeona was the goddess of outward journeys and protector of children when they leave home. The Abeona project is a home education project to help us teach our kids about computers, data and travel.

The project is intended to start off as a place to provide reviews of various attractions, playgrounds, etc. The idea is to collect information and use this information to demonstrate how you can analyse and represent data in a variety of ways.

I'd also like to add in a number of new technologies to add a little bit of fun but also as conversation starters to try and get us talking about things like social responsibility, the careful use of social networking and privacy.

I'm also using this project in order to learn a few new things so if it's a bit rough around the edges then please forgive me.
 
If anyone else wants to contribute to this project then please feel free.
